    "The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula \"all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus\".\n",
    "It would be intersting and useful to classify the different types of Iris flowers having the sepal and petal sizes."
